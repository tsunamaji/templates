Tempalte: **Vite v7 (with TypeScript) + Vue v3 + Sass v1 + TailwindCSS v4**

This template is a Vite-based Vue project using TypeScript, with Sass and TailwindCSS employed for styling.

TailwindCSS v4 no longer supports preprocessors, so Sass can only be used side-by-side. They do not work together when integrated. This limitation inspired the creation of the template, providing a very small example for demonstration purposes.

## Create yourself

```none
pnpm create vite@latest {project_name} -- --template vue-ts
cd {project_name}
pnpm i -D sass@1 tailwindcss@4 @tailwindcss/vite
```

It may be necessary to perform some configuration in addition to installing the dependencies.

**vite.config.ts**
```diff
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
+ import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
  
  // https://vite.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      vue(),
+     tailwindcss(),
    ],
  })
```

**./src/tailwind.css** (NEW)
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

**./src/styles.scss** (RENAMED from **style.css**)
```css
/* Your SCSS code here; without TailwindCSS */
```

**./src/main.ts**
```diff
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
- import './style.css'
+ import './style.scss'
+ import './tailwind.css'
  import App from './App.vue'
  
  createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

**./package.json**
```diff
  {
+   "imports": {
+     "#tailwind.css": "./src/tailwind.css"
+   },
  }
```

Make sure that Sass code never references TailwindCSS classes, and TailwindCSS code never references Sass classes or variables. These are separate, isolated code sections.

When using CSS Modules and style blocks, make sure not to mix Sass and TailwindCSS code. However, you can use variables generated by one system in the other, since the browser will declare them with the same specificity, making them accessible to all other classes.

Consider using layers, as this gives you greater control over CSS specificity. Unlayered CSS can be overly strong.

For TailwindCSS, you might choose not to use CSS Modules or style blocks, although this is just a recommendation and not mandatory. Here are some references explaining why:
* [**Why stop using `@apply`**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79449440/15167500)

In this example, you will find global CSS configurations for both Sass and TailwindCSS, as well as style block (CSS Module) configurations. It is important to note that in Vue, multiple style blocks can be declared, but they should not be mixed (Sass should not be combined with TailwindCSS).

Additionally, the template includes the VSCode configurations required for TailwindCSS, and it's worth checking them yourself.
